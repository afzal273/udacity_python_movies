# Movie Trailer Website

This is the first project from Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

In order to see the output file, you can simply open the 'fresh_tomatoes.html' file.

You can also run the entertainment_center.py file which will generate the html file and open it in your browser.

- If you're running the entertainment_center.py, you'll need a rotten tomatoes API key which you need to save in the 'rt_api_key.txt' file.
- It should look like 
<pre>
<code>
cat rt_api_key.txt
your_api_key
</code>
</pre>

The movie class (in media.py) is using the [Rotten Tomatoes API](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/docs) to get some movie info.
